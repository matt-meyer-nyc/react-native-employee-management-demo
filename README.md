##This is a simple app that allows for an employer to sign in, and schedule a day to for work for an employee. There's a screen to list all employees schedule, and another screen for creating an updating the list. If they want to 'fire' (remove) an employee that option exists as well. Navigation is incorporated to move from screen to screen.

##*Being a demo, this only allows for the functionality of signing in and signing up for shifts (just by day), and retrieving that info. Using the following email/password will allow access - email: jim@test.com / password: 123456*

##**To run: clone root directory, run and npm install, and then the command 'react-native run-ios' the app can then be used via the simulator** 

Thank you to Stephen Grider for his Udemy course 'The Complete React Native and Redux Course' which provided the guidance for the flow of the framework.

*note: demo assumes user has some basic knowledge of react-native's simulator and has also installed this library*
