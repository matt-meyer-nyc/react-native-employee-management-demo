##This is a simple app that allows for employees to sign in, and schedule a day to work, and also add their phone number, which can later be retrieved, or updated. This app uses Firebase as a server to maintain authentication of emails/password.

##*Being a demo, this only allows for the functionality of signing in and signing up for shifts (just by day), and retrieving that info. Using the following email/password will allow access - email: jim@test.com / password: 123456*

##**To run: clone root directory, run and npm install, and then the command 'react-native run-ios' the app can then be used via the simulator** 

Thank you to Stephen Grider for his Udemy course 'The Complete React Native and Redux Course' which provided the guidance for the flow of the framework.

*note: demo assumes user has some basic knowledge of react-native's simulator and has also installed this library*
